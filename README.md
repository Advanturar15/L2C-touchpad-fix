# L2C-touchpad-fix
My classmate had problem with her lenovo trackpad as I'd stop working and even the touchpad option from the start menu disappeared. I saw turning it on and off works regardless of how many times I install and remove drivers. 

Here is how to use it - 

Past this in your desired folder (I used C:\Scripts).

Put the script there, Go to device manager and copy the 'ACPI' of the touchpad from properties and past it in the code. 

Go to ask scheduler and schedule this script to run. For me personally, it only worked after I set it up to run after the user logins. 

Hope this fix helps.
